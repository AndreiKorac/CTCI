## Overview

This repository is a (currently in-progress) collection of solutions to various questions in Cracking the Coding Interview.

it contains two pairs of projects, each of which is a class library with corresponding unit test library.

The first is the actual solutions I wrote to the problems in the book, with a set of unit tests I wrote alongside their implementation.

The second is a library of assorted data structures and algorithms I wrote as practice over the course of each chapter, again with corresponding unit tests.

The solutions and DSA implementations (and all associated tests) are by no means exhaustive and this is a continuous learning process.

## Usage

Navigate into the SolutionsTests folder and run

`dotnet test`

To run the tests associated with the book problems (likewise for DSATests if for whatever reason you want to do that too).
