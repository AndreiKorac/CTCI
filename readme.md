## Overview

This repository is a (currently in-progress) collection of solutions to various questions in Cracking the Coding Interview.

it contains two pairs of projects, each of which is a class library with corresponding unit test library.

The first is the actual solutions I wrote to the problems in the book, with a set of unit tests I wrote alongside their implementation.

The second is a library of assorted data structures and algorithms I wrote as practice over the course of each chapter, again with corresponding unit tests.
