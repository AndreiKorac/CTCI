## Overview

This repository is a (currently in-progress) collection of solutions to various questions in Cracking the Coding Interview.

It is structured as two C# class libraries, one containing classes per chapter with the implementations within, one containing unit tests written in NUnit corresponding to the implementations.

This repo is essentially a copy-over of an old repo of CTCI solutions/tests I started a month or two ago. 
Its purpose was to brush up on data structures, algorithms, and whiteboard-type questions, whilst also practicing unit testing.
